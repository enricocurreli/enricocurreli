# Enrico Curreli

## 🚀 Full Stack Web Developer

Hi there! I'm Enrico, a Full Stack Web Developer passionate about designing and building **clean, robust REST APIs** and modern web applications. I have developed my skills through academic training and professional bootcamps, including Aulab's Full Stack Development program, advanced React.js Masterclasses, and Adecco Academy MuleSoft — an intensive program focused on integration, APIs, and real-world projects.

I'm currently working on my **Bachelor's thesis**: a full-stack, API-based application for the **healthcare sector**, built with NestJS, TypeORM and MySQL.

I'm eager to specialize in **web application security**, implementing advanced protection measures to ensure user data safety, and contributing to stimulating projects — whether locally or abroad.
